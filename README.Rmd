# rChEA3

**An R client for the [ChEA3](https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/) transcription factor enrichment API.**

While ChEA3 is only available online as a web server, rChEA3 provides access to this tool directly in R, streamlining transcription factor enrichment into your workflow. Submit gene lists, retrieve TF rankings from multiple evidence sources (ChIP-seq, co-expression, literature), and integrate results into your R/Bioconductor analysis pipeline.

The package includes convenient functions to query the API, retrieve results across collections, prepare outputs for downstream analysis, and generate publication-ready figures.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rChEA3 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ckntav/rChEA3")
```

## Quick start

This quick example demonstrates how to conveniently interogate the ChEA3 tool.

```{r, load_library}
library(rChEA3)
```

### 1. Query ChEA3

```{r, query}
my_gene_list <- c("KLK3", "AR", "FKBP5", "TMPRSS2", "KLK2", "CYP1B1")

results <- queryChEA3(my_gene_list)
```

This function sends the query gene list to the ChEA3 web server and performs the transcription factor enrichment analysis.
Once the analysis is complete, the available results from different collections are displayed.

### 2. Inspect top results

The function displayTopN() allows quick inspection of the results by showing the top-ranked transcription factors from each collection.
By default, the top 10 transcription factors are displayed for every collection, without applying any threshold on score, p-value, or FDR.

```{r, inspect}
displayTopN(results)
```

### 3. Extract results from a specific collection

The function queryChEA3() returns a list of data frames, one for each ChEA3 collection.
Each element of the list contains transcription factors (TFs) with their associated statistics (rank, score, p-value, or FDR depending on the collection).

To access a specific result table, use the variable storing the results and specify the corresponding collection name. These tables can be indexed by name, explored, filtered, and integrated into downstream R/Bioconductor analyses.

As an example, the Mean Rank integrated results can be retrieved with:

```{r, extract}
meanRank_results <- results[["Integrated--meanRank"]]
head(meanRank_results)
```

This table contains the averaged ranks of transcription factors across all ChEA3 libraries, providing a global view of TF enrichment for your gene set.

#### 4. Visualize results

The function visualizeRank() creates a bar plot of the top-ranked transcription factors from a result table.
By default, the plot displays the most significant TFs in descending order, making it easy to quickly identify the strongest candidates for your gene list.

```{r visualize, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, dpi=300}
visualizeRank(meanRank_results)
```
